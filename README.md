# ExchangeSolutions

In this project, we extract business insights about customer purchasing behaviors primarily by location, into a dynamic dashboard. This dashboard provides a graphical presentation of:
1. the relationship between the quantity of items ordered, order frequency, and the amount of money made by the organization per location.
2. the consumer distribution and how this impacts the sales made in each location.
3. the locations with the highest and lowest demand.
